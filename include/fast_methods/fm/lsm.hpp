/*! \class LSM
    \brief Implements Lock Sweeping Method.

    It uses as a main container the nDGridMap class. The nDGridMap type T
    has to use an FMCell or derived.

    The grid is assumed to be squared, that is Delta(x) = Delta(y) = leafsize_

    NOTE: The sweeping directions are inverted with respect to the paper to make implementation easier. And sweeping
    is implemented recursively (undetermined number of nested for loops) to achieve n-dimensional behaviour.
