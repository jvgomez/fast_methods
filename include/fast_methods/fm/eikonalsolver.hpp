/*! \class EikonalSolver
    \brief Abstract class that serves as interface for the actual EikonalSolvers implemented.
    It requires (at least) the computeInternal method to be implemented,

    It uses as a main container the nDGridMap class. The nDGridMap template paramenter
    has to be an FMCell or something inherited from it.
